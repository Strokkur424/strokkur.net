Permissions are a very substantial part of making sure that a command is not executed by people
who should not execute the command. For this, StrokkCommands provides you with two additional
annotations: `@Permission` and `@RequiresOP`.

## Applying requirement annotation
The permission annotations are also refer to as "requirement annotations", since they add a `.requires` clause
to the command tree.

You can add requirement annotations to either an executing method or to the command class itself.
So either of these works fine:

```java
@RequiresOP
@Command("deopme")
class DeopMeCommand {

  @Executes
  @RequiresOP
  void execute(CommandSender sender) {
    sender.setOp(false);
  }
}
```

### Subcommand annotations
StrokkCommands automatically does some moving around of the permission.
For example, if we have a command `/gui [admin]`, where all users should be able to execute `/gui`, but only
operators `/gui admin`, you can register the command as follows:

```java
@Command("gui")
class GuiCommand {

  @Executes
  void executeUser(CommandSender sender, @Executor Player player) {
    /* ... */
  }

  // Only /gui admin requires op!
  @RequiresOP
  @Executes("admin")
  void executeAdmin(CommandSender sender, @Executor Player player) {
    /* ... */
  }
}
```

### Merging requirements
If your command has exactly two paths: `/trigger off` and `/trigger on`, where both should have different permissions
(`yourplugin.commands.trigger.off` and `yourplugin.commands.trigger.on`), StrokkCommands automatically adds a requirement to `/trigger`, in
which you need to have **either** the `on` or `off` permissions to run the command. This ensures that regular players
do not have a random `/trigger` command floating around which they cannot use.

## Using permissions instead of op status
Instead of relying on `@RequiresOP`, you should almost always define a permission using `@Permission("...")` instead.
You can declare the permission in your `(paper-)plugin.yml` and set the default to `op`.

```yml title=(paper-)plugin.yml
permissions:
  yourplugin.commands.trigger.on:
    default: op
    description: Permission for /trigger on
  yourplugin.commands.trigger.off:
    default: op
    description: Permission for /trigger off
```

This ensures that server owners have full customizability over which commands users can execute.

The same principle also applies to commands which you think should be accessible by everyone. Always put
permissions on your commands and subcommands! Whilst your intended defaults might be good defaults,
they might not fit every server owner's use case. You can always define a permission to be `true` by default.

```yml title=(paper-)plugin.yml
permissions:
  yourplugin.commands.customaction:
    default: true
    description: Permission for /customaction on
```
